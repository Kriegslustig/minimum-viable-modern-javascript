```
$ npm init
```
 
_/package.json_
 
```
{
  "name": "my-awesome-package",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "My awesome package which does nothing",
  "main": "index.js",
…
  "author": "superman &lt;superman@metropolis.gov&gt;",
  "license": "UNLICENSED",
…
}
```</main><aside>First You'll need to create a package.json file. Its most important features are keeping holding the version of your package, keeping track of dependencies and their version(-constraints) and build automation.
 
`npm init` helps you with that.
 
Here we can see what `npm` creates for us, when we run that command. For the most part this is pretty self explanetory. Except for the `"license"` property maybe. It has to be a valid SPDX-License expression. By declaring `"UNLICESED"`, we retain all rights (for now).</aside></section><section><main># NPM – Scripts
_/package.json_
 
```
…
"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
},
…
```</main><aside>NPM-scripts are a very popular way to wrap build scripts. Every developer on NPM knows where to find them. So you mostly don't need to even document you're npm-scripts, since every developer will know to look into the `package.json` before doing anything else.
 
Basically NPM-scripts are just shell scripts. The only thing special about them, is how they are run. When running them NPM puts the `./node_modules` directory into your `$PATH`. We'll see what this helps us with later.
 
NPM-scripts can be run using the `npm run[-script] [script-name]` command. To run this test-script (that does nothing except raising an exception) we can run `npm run test`. There are some special scriptnames that are aliased by NPM. `test` is one of them. So you may also run `npm test` to run it. There are some more special NPM scripts. Most importantly `[post|pre]install`. These scripts are automatically run before and after a package is installed. These are sometimes used in malicious packets to inject malware. Read more about NPM-scripts [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts#description).</aside></section><section><main># NPM – Further properties
_/package.json_
 
```
…
"private": true,
"engines": {
  "node": ">=4.0"
},
…
```</main><aside>Here are some other properties you might want to add. The `"private"` property prevents the packaged from accidently being published on npmjs.com. The `"engines"` property simply defines compatible versions of node. Read more about the `package.json` [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json).</aside></section><section><main># NPM – Dependencies
```
$ npm install --save-dev webpack
```
 
_/package.json_
```
"devDependencies": {
  "webpack": "^1.13.1"
…
```</main><aside>Dependencies are also store inside the `package.json` file. You may manage them manually inside the `package.json`. Though in most cases it's best to use the CLI. By default NPM just puts dependencies inside a `node_modules` directory and doesn't manipulate the `package.json`. So when running `npm install webpack`, NPM will download the dependency and put it in `node_modules`, but the `package.json` file won't have changed. Say you are using SVC system (like Git) and are ignoring `node_modules` to avoid commiting someone elses modules. When someone else clones your project and installs your it by running `npm install`, Webpack won't be installed.
 
For a dependency to be installed, it needs to be set as a dependency inside the `package.json` file. For that to be done by NPM we need to use the `--save` switch. So when running `npm install --save webpack`, `"webpack": "^1.13.1"` will be added to `package.json`. The `^` means, that any version of the package that is "compatible" (by [semver](http://semver.org/)) with the version following `^`. Path and minor upgrades are considered compatible.
 
In the example we are using `--save-dev`. It's does the same as `--save` but instead of adding it to `"dependencies"`, it adds it to `"devDependencies"`. These are dependencies that should only be installed in a development environment. Detection for development environments is done by reading the `$NODE_ENV` environment variable. If `$NODE_ENV` isn't set, its interpreted as a development environment. More on that later.
 
In pure front-end projects, **that won't be published as packages**, I like to add dependencies that are later bundled as `"dependencies"` instead of adding them as `devDependencies`. That makes the `package.json` a bit more readable.
 
There are some other kinds of dependencies. You can read more about these [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies).
 
Maybe a word of caution here. Using `npm install` can be very dangerous. As said previously `install`-scipts are sometimes used for malicious purposes. These attacks are expecially popular for [typosquatters](http://incolumitas.com/2016/06/08/typosquatting-package-managers/). So be carefull when typing out package names. Alternatively you may use something like the following as a safeguard against it:
```
npmi () {
  local A
  npm info ${1} | less
  echo "?"
  read A
  if [ -n $A ]; then
    npm i ${@}
  fi
}
```</aside></section><section><main># Questions?
[![what?!](https://media.giphy.com/media/sRb7yNtTJAtZS/giphy.gif)](http://giphy.com/gifs/doctor-who-what-tenth-sRb7yNtTJAtZS)</main><aside>Any questions about NPM?</aside></section><section><main># Configuring Webpack
_/webpack.config.js_
 
```
module.exports = {
  entry: { main: './src' },
  output: {
    filename: '[name].js',
    path: __dirname + '/dist'
  }
},
devtool: '#source-map'
```</main><aside>The best way to pass options to Webpack is to use a configuration file. Here's a the most basic configuration file. All it does is take a `./src/index.js`, resolve it's dependencies and bundle it in `./dist/main.js`.
 
The `entry` property defines _entry-points_, which Webpack should bundle. If we pass a directory, it'll search for a file called `index.js` inside of it.
 
For the most part this configuration is pretty self-explainatory. So I don't want to get in too deep here. If you want to have some more background on the options we're using, check [the `webpack.config.js` of this project](https://github.com/Kriegslustig/minimum-viable-modern-javascript/blob/master/webpack.config.js). It contains tons of detailed explanaitions for the options we're using.
 
`__dirname` is a global variable in Node.js that contains an absolute path to the directory inside of which the current module is stored. This configuration still has one problem though. Cross-Platform compatibility.
 
`devtool` are developer tool options. Here we are enabling source-maps. The `#` is to enforce [pragma style](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/developertools/sourcemaps/#toc-howwork). More [here](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#devtool).</aside></section><section><main># Webpack – Compatibility
_/webpack.config.js_
 
```
var path = require('path')
…
module.exports = {
  output: {
    filename: '[name].js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  }
…
```</main><aside>We can use the `path.resolve` function as a OS-independent way to get an absolute path to something. We don't need to do the same for the entrypoints since `require` handles then, which already has path normalization built-in.</aside></section><section><main># Webpack – Loaders
```
$ npm i -S \
    babel-core \
    babel-loader \
    babel-preset-es2015
```</main><aside>Webpack loaders define how certain file types should be treated when beeing loaded as modules. Having a richt ecosystem of loaders is what makes Webpack so great.
 
Here we are installing Babel. [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) is a JavaScript compiler. It provides an interface for Plugins like `babel-preset-es2015` to manipulate JS in an easy and fast way. `babel-preset-es2015` makes Babel transpile ES6 to ES5. So it's quiet handy. Babel is completely independent of Webpack. `babel-loader` is the "adapter" to Webpack. We can configure it inside our `webpack.config.js` and it'll pipe our JS through Babel for us.</aside></section><section><main># Webpack – Loaders
_/webpack.config.js_
 
```
module.exports = {
…
module.exports = {
  module: {
    loaders: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        loader: 'babel?presets[]=es2015&cacheDirectory',
        include: [ path.resolve(__dirname, 'src') ]
…
```</main><aside>To configure it, we need to add a `module` property to our configuration. It contains options related to module handling. `module.loaders` is an array containing the actual loaders. A loader-object must contain a `test` and a `loader` property. `test` is a RegExp matched against the whole filepath of a module. Here we are matching against the `.js` extension.
 
The `loader` property is a '!' seperated string of loaders. A loader should be the name of an installed loader. The `-loader` extension is optional and added by webpack if it's not explicitly used. So `babel` resolves to `babel-loader`. The querystring contains options that are passed to the loader. The `name[]=value` pattern is used for arrays so you could do `name[]=first&name[]=second`. Here it's specifically used to enable the `babel-preset-es2015` package. We are also enabling the Babel `cacheDirectory` for Babel to properly cache the compiled modules.
 
Lastly, the `include` property. It defines which directories the loader should be used for. It's used, so that we don't have to pipe all NPM modules through our loader.</aside></section><section><main># Webpack – Plugins
_/webpack.config.js_
 
```
…
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new webpack.optimize.DedupePlugin()
  ],
…
```</main><aside>Plugins change the internal behaviour of Webpack. Some plugins are shipped as part of the Webpack core package. One of them is `webpack.optimize.DedupePlugin`. Its one of those features that really set Webpack apart from similar tools. Deduping (deduplicating) is a powerful compression technique that eliminates duplicates in filesets. This plugin does that for JavaScript code.
 
Running dedupe with every build is discuraged. Instead it should only be run when going to production. So let's see how we might go about doing that.</aside></section><section><main># Webpack – Dev/Prod
_/webpack.config.js_
 
```
…
var dev = process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
var plugins = []
if (!dev) {
  plugins.push(new webpack.optimize.DedupePlugin())
}
…
module.exports = {
  plugins: plugins,
  dev
    ? '#source-map'
    : '',
…
```</main><aside>This is quiet straigt forward. As we have discovered before, NPM uses the `NODE_ENV` variable to decide wether or not to install `devDependencies`. We can use that same variable to decide wether or not to run dedupe and compile source-maps.
 
To read environment variables, we can use the `process.env` object. It contains all environment variables. So here dev is true if the `NODE_ENV` is not equal to production.
 
To compile the production code we'd now have to run `NODE_ENV=production webpack`. Straight forward enough. Dough we could integrate it into our NPM-scripts.</aside></section><section><main># Webpack – NPM-Scripts
_/package.json_
 
```
…
"scripts": {
  "build": "NODE_ENV=production webpack -p",
  "ms-build": "set NODE_ENV=production && webpack -p && set NODE_ENV=development",
  "watch-build": "webpack --watch",
…
```</main><aside>First we add the script described on the last slide as `"build"`. Additionally we set the `-p` flag to trigger some [additional optimization](https://webpack.github.io/docs/cli.html#production-shortcut-p).
 
To achive the same on DOS systems, we can use powershell. Its syntax is a little different. That's what `"ms-build"` is for.
 
Finally `"watch-build"` runs the build in debugging mode and reruns it whenever something changes</aside></section><section><main># Any Questions?</main></section><section><main># Further reading
